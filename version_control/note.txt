Git Version Control - Summary
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code, helps collaboration, and maintains project history.

Basic Git Workflow:
Initialize a Git repository: git init
Check status: git status
Stage files: git add . (or specific files)
Commit changes: git commit -m "Message"
Push to remote repository:
Connect to remote: git remote add origin <URL>
Push changes: git push origin main
Branching & Merging:
Create a branch: git branch feature-branch
Switch branch: git checkout feature-branch
Merge into main:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
git branch -d feature-branch
Undoing Changes:
Unstage a file: git reset HEAD filename
Revert last commit (keep changes): git reset --soft HEAD~1
Revert last commit (remove changes): git reset --hard HEAD~1
Syncing with Remote Repository:
Clone: git clone <URL>
Pull latest changes: git pull origin main
Push changes: git push origin main
Best Practices:
✅ Commit frequently with clear messages
✅ Use branches for features and bug fixes
✅ Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
✅ Review changes before committing (git status, git diff)
