        Chinua Achebe (1930â€“2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, professor, and
        critic, widely regarded as the father of modern African literature. He
        gained international fame with his debut novel, Things Fall Apart
        (1958), which explores the impact of colonialism on Igbo society.
        Achebe's works, including Arrow of God, No Longer at Ease, and Anthills
        of the Savannah, address themes of tradition, identity, and power
        struggles in post-colonial Africa. A strong advocate for African
        storytelling, Achebe challenged Western narratives about Africa. He also
        worked as an editor, academic, and political activist. His literary
        contributions earned him numerous awards, including the Man Booker
        International Prize in 2007.
